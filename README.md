# aws-solution

The proposed solution uses AWS Transit Gateway as a central hub for network connectivity combined with AWS Direct Connect as the primary connection path and Site-to-Site VPN as a backup. This architecture addresses the IP address overlap challenge using Network Address Translation (NAT) while maintaining high-performance connectivity between all three environments.
